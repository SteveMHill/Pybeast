# rbeast: A Python package for Bayesian changepoint detection and time series decomposition

####  BEAST (Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend) is a fast, generic Bayesian model averaging algorithm to decompose time series or 1D sequential data into individual components, such as abrupt changes, trends, and periodic/seasonal variations, as described in <ins>[Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019)</ins>. BEAST is useful for changepoint detection (i.e., breakpoints or structural breaks), nonlinear trend analysis, time series decomposition, and time series segmentation. See a list of <ins>[selected studies using BEAST](#selected-publications-using-beastrbeast)</ins>.
> **BEAST** was impemented in C/C++ but accessible from  R, Python, and Matlab. Code and more information are available at https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast.

**Quick installation**:
   * For Python, run **`pip install rbeast`**   
   * In Matlab, run **`eval(webread('http://b.link/beast',weboptions('cert','')))`**  
   * In R,      run **`install.packages("Rbeast")`**
   

## Installation for Python

  A python package **`rbeast`** has been deposited at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). In a console, run the command below to install:
  
  ```python
    pip install rbeast
  ```
 

 ## Run and test rbeast in Python

  ```python
    import rbeast as rb
    nile = rb.load_example('nile')
    o    = rb.beast( nile["flow"], start=1871, season='none')
    rb.plot(o)
    rb.print(o)
  ```
 
   

## Description
Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for the same data–a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition by forgoing the "single-best-model" concept and embracing all competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, finance, public health, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST are reported in [Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019). The paper is available at https://go.osu.edu/beast2019.
